# DSC140_Final

The Excel Workbook contains mostly graphs about the dataset I chose
The dataset I chose was a pokemon dataset about the stats of the first 6 generations
Inside of the Python notebook contains all the algorithms I used in my report.
Also inside the Python Notebook are calculations I used and a lot of graphs I ended
up not using in the end of the report. Everything in the excel workbook
was used.

The CSV File is the pokemon dataset used in my report and it was pulled from Kaggle.com
